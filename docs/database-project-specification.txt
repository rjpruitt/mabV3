DATABASE PROJECT SPECIFICATION
Mid America Bathworks & Associated Companies
Last Updated: [Current Date]

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
==================
Purpose: Design, develop, and implement a multi-tenant database system supporting multiple 
related home service businesses with shared customer relationships.

Primary Businesses:
- Mid America Bathworks (bathroom remodeling, accessibility modifications)
- Solid State Foundation Solutions (foundation repair services)
- Caring For Us (senior care services and transition assistance)

Key Requirements:
- Support shared customer relationships across businesses
- Enable family/household relationship tracking
- Maintain data isolation where needed
- Support comprehensive analytics and reporting

1.1 DEVELOPMENT ARCHITECTURE
===========================
The system follows a modern microservices architecture pattern, allowing independent 
development and deployment of components while maintaining system cohesion.

1. Component Separation
   Database as a Service (DBaaS)
   - Independent development and deployment
   - Single source of truth
   - Separate versioning and scaling
   - Accessed through defined APIs

2. Application Independence

    3. Provider-Agnostic Implementation
       Implementation Strategy:
       - Use database abstraction layer
       - Implement connection pooling
       - Standardize configuration
       - Plan for portability

       Example Configuration Interface:
       ```typescript
       interface DatabaseConfig {
         host: string;
         port: number;
         username: string;
         password: string;
         database: string;
         ssl?: boolean;
         pooling?: {
           max: number;
           idle: number;
         };
       }
       ```

       Example Service Layer:
       ```typescript
       class DatabaseService {
         private static instance: DatabaseService;
         private pool: Pool;

         private constructor(config: DatabaseConfig) {
           // Initialize connection pool
         }

         public static getInstance(config: DatabaseConfig) {
           if (!DatabaseService.instance) {
             DatabaseService.instance = new DatabaseService(config);
           }
           return DatabaseService.instance;
         }

         // Database operations
       }
       ```

    4. Migration Considerations
