Kitchens and bathrooms are the two rooms that most often sell homes. The bathroom remodels have the highest ROI. It may be more beneficial to remodel a bathroom than start a project in every room. It's not necessary to gut the entire room."

### Shower and Tub Insights
From Gehman Remodeling:
- "The focal point of any bathroom is the shower and/or tub"
- "Replacing your tub with a large walk-in shower can raise your home's value"
- "Adding glass doors to your tub or shower is a high-impact upgrade that will appeal to most buyers"
- Important Note: "Make sure at least one bathroom in your home has a bathtub, as buyers with small children will consider that a 'must-have' feature"
