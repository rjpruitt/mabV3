## DESIGN CONSULTATION FLOW - IMPORTANT NOTE:
All components and code for this flow have been completed, tested, and are working correctly.
DO NOT modify, recode, or redesign any aspect unless specifically requested.

+ ## ACCESSIBILITY ASSESSMENT FLOW - CURRENT FOCUS
+ Location: src/components/ui/accessibility-consultation/
+ 
+ Current Status:
+ - Created folder structure mirroring design consultation
+ - Moved success-message.tsx to accessibility-consultation folder
+ - Created initial components and types
+ - Working on type compatibility issues
+ 
+ Files Created/Modified:
+ - accessibility-consultation.tsx (main modal)
+ - success-message.tsx (moved from ui/)
+ - types.ts (accessibility-specific types)
+ - conversation-flow.ts (accessibility flow)
+ - questions/ownership-questions.tsx
+ - questions/medicare-status.tsx
+ - questions/single-select.tsx (copied from design)
+ - questions/multi-select.tsx (copied from design)
+ - questions/contact-form.tsx (copied from design)
+ 
+ Current Issue:
+ - Type error in accessibility-consultation.tsx:
+   SingleSelect component expects ConversationStep but receives AccessibilityStep
+ - Need to update SingleSelect to use our own types
+ 
+ Next Steps:
+ 1. Update SingleSelect component to use AccessibilityStep type
+ 2. Ensure complete independence from design consultation
+ 3. Test full flow functionality
+ 
+ Critical Context:
+ - Each flow (design and accessibility) must be completely independent
+ - No cross-dependencies between flows
+ - Each flow has its own components and types
+ - Deleting one flow should not affect the other
+ 
+ Current Error:
+ Type 'AccessibilityStep' is not assignable to type 'ConversationStep'
+ Types of property 'id' are incompatible
+ Type 'AccessibilityStepId' is not assignable to type 'StepId'
+ 
+ Remember:
+ - Do not modify design consultation files
+ - Keep flows completely separate
+ - Copy components instead of sharing
+ - Use local types for each flow
